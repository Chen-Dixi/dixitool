    in supervised learning, we often want to count the test accuracy.
    but the dataset size maybe is not dividable by batch size, causing a remainder fraction which is annoying.
    also, sometimes we want to keep trace with accuracy in each mini-batch(like in train mode)
    this class is a simple class for counting accuracy.
